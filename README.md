# Webhook Contentful app

> A Contentful App to trigger a custom webhook from the sidebar.

![Screenshot of the Configuration Screen and the Webhook app in the sidebar](./screenshot.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Contentful App](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app).

## Setup

[The Contentful App Framework](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/) allows developers to extend the Contentful UI with custom functionality. You can install the app and use its hosted version without editing any code.

To install this app head over to your organization settings and create a new app.

![Installation dialog](./docs/installation.png)

Define the application name you prefer and the following App URL: `https://webhook-contentful-app.vercel.app`.

**While anyone is free to make use of the public app be aware that USAGE IS AT OWN RISK.** The public version is tightly coupled to my use case and can change. There is no guarantee for backwards-compatibility.

**It's recommended to fork the repository and deploy your own version.**

This app supports the following locations in the Contentful UI:

- (Required) App configuration screen (`app-config`) â€“ configure and define webhooks that will be trigger from the sidebar
- (Required) Entry sidebar (`entry-sidebar`) - trigger HTTP webhooks

_Make sure to enable the App configuration screen to configure the application._

![App configuration dialog](./docs/app-config.png)

Install the app into your preferred space. Create and save a new webhook in it's app configuration.

![Content type sidebar configuration dialog](./docs/sidebar-config.png)

Enter the content modelling section in your space and modify the sidebar configation of a content type to show the app in the sidebar.

## Development

### Prerequisites

The following dependencies should be installed:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) ^12.16.3
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) ^6.14.4

### Getting started

1. Run the following commands in your console.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yn5/webhook-contentful-app.git
cd webhook-contentful-app
npm ci
```

2. Start the development server

```bash
npm run start
```

Creates or update your app definition in contentful, and runs the app in development mode on http://localhost:3000.
Open your app to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

3. Generate the built app

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates a production bundle that you can host on various hosting platforms.

### Styling

For styling [@emotion/styled-components](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) is used.

For positioning a component [emotion's "Styling any component" functionality](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled#styling-any-component) for extending styles is preferred in order to keep the DOM elements to a minimum:

```javascript
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import Menu from './menu';

const StyledMenu = styled(Menu)`
  top: 96px;
  left: 96px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
`;

export default function Example() {
  return <StyledMenu />;
}
```

### Committing

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is used to run the `lint`, `format` and `test` scripts before every commit and only allows the commit if all scripts pass successfully.

For commit messages, [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) is used.

The Git workflow is lightly based on [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

Please branch a new feature branch of the [`develop`](https://github.com/edenspiekermann-amsterdam/elsevier-health-student-hub.git) branch for every new feature with the following title: `feature/name-of-the-new-feature`.

All bugfixes should be developed inside a new `bugfix/name-of-the-bug` branch.

All (npm) dependency additions / installs and removals / uninstalls should be in a separate commit.

**Please rebase your feature branch on the most recent version of `develop` in order to update your `feature/` or `bugfix/` branch with the latest `develop` and before creating a pull request.**

### Tests

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.
>
> [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/807626710350839808)

For testing [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) and [jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/) are used. The tests can be found in the [src/\_\_tests\_\_/](src/__tests__/) folder. The filename of a test file should end with `.spec.ts(x)`.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run the test in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```
